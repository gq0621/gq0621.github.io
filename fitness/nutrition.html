            <h1>Common Exercises</h1>
            <p>The following are common exercises that we encourage our clients to do as part of their daily exercise routine.</p>
            <dl>
                <dt>Burpee</dt>
                <dd>Burpees are great full body exercise to increase your strength and endurance. Begin in a standing position, drop into a squat and extend your hands forward, kick your feet back and then forward again quickly, and then jump up from a squatted position.</dd>

                <dt>Plank</dt>
                <dd> A plank is a simple, effective bodyweight exercise that requires no equipment and can be performed just about anywhere (well, use your judgment). Place forearms on the floor with elbows aligned below shoulders and arms parallel to your body at about shoulder width. If flat palms bother your wrists, clasp your hands together.</dd>

                <dt>Mountain Climber</dt>
                <dd>Mountain climbers are great for building cardio endurance, core strength, and agility. Drop into a top press-up position, supporting your weight on your hands and toes, with your arms straight and your legs extended. Keeping your core braced and your shoulders, hips and feet in a straight line throughout, bring one knee towards your chest, then return it to the starting position. Repeat the movement with your other leg, then continue alternating legs throughout.</dd>
